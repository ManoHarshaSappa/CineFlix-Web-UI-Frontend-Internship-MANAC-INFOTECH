# CineFlix - Web UI Interface

This project is a **feature-rich frontend web application** developed during my internship at **MANAC INFOTECH PRIVATE LIMITED** as part of their *Web Application Development* initiative. The goal was to design a modern, responsive movie-streaming interface with an engaging user experienceâ€”something similar to Netflix, but purely frontend-driven.

## Internship Context

As an intern at **MANAC INFOTECH PRIVATE LIMITED**, I had the opportunity to work on real-world projects that challenged my design and coding skills. This particular project involved:

- Creating a fully functional, responsive movie carousel
- Implementing custom UI components like a fixed navbar, animated sliders, watchlist buttons, etc.
- Using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JS** (no frameworks)

This hands-on experience helped me sharpen my frontend fundamentals and later inspired the foundation for my personal **developer portfolio website**.

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- CodeSandbox Template
- Git & GitHub for version control

## Features

- Smooth sliding carousel animation
- Hover-based preview transition
- Fully responsive layout with modern look
- Styled navigation bar with search & login

## My Role

I independently handled:
- Layout structuring
- CSS animations & transitions
- JavaScript-based dynamic behaviors
- Custom component design

## What's Next?

Iâ€™ve adapted many of these components and UI principles while building my [developer portfolio site](#) to showcase my projects and journey.
